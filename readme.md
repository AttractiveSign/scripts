# Personal Scripts Repository

This repository contains a collection of scripts that I use for university projects as well as personal convenience. The goal is to have a centralized place for small utilities, experiments, and exercises in various programming languages.

## Current Scripts

- **rename.sh**: Batch rename files by appending a custom suffix.  
- **try_host.py**: Periodically pings a host, displaying the host, timestamp, and ping time in milliseconds.  
- **mkfile.c**: Interactive C program that prompts for a filename and creates an empty file with restricted permissions (`0700`).
